# Automated-Executive-Reporting
Created an automated workflow that queries data from SQL, updates Excel charts, generates a PowerPoint, and delivers an Outlook e-mail.

## Objective

This project is meant to demonstrate the efficiencies of automating routine reporting/analytics as a service when productionizing the process into a dashboard or other tool may not be viable.

The end-to-end stages of the project workflow are:

1). Create a synthetic data set for a hypothetical car sales company and then load the data into a simply star schema database via MySQL Workbench.
2).
